Introduction 



Full-Stack Development using the MERN Stack is a modern approach to building web applications. The acronym MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building robust APIs. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Together, they provide a seamless development experience, allowing developers to use JavaScript throughout the entire stack. This technology stack is ideal for developing scalable, high-performance web applications. The MERN stack's modularity and open-source nature contribute to its popularity and extensive community support. It also facilitates rapid development and deployment, making it a preferred choice for startups and large enterprises alike.
